Upgrading the FIRSTWA Dual Recorder app

(Some changes to the installer were needed. Sorry if this is a little complex. Next update will be easier!)

1) Start the existing FIRSTWA Dual Recorder application
2) Open Settings->Recording
3) Make a note of the IP addresses here, you will want to re enter them later
4) Close the application
5) The program needs to be uninstalled before installing the new version. In Settings -> Apps look up FIRSTWA Dual Recorder and uninstall it

6) On the Onedrive for firstwacase59@outlook.com, find the FIRSTWADualRecorder install directory. Double click the FIRSTWADualRecordInstall.msi file
7) Should have installed a new FIRSTWADualRecorder shortcut on your desktop. It is also in the Start Menu under FIRSTWA 
8) Start the new program
9) Go to Settings->Recording and reset the IP addresses from Step 2
10) Right click the REC icon on the taskbar and do a pin to taskbar.

Having an issue on my machine with the icon for the Dual recorder program. Will get it working.
